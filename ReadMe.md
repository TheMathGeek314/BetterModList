# BetterModList

This mod allows you to make changes to the layout of the mod list seen in the menu. However, for moderation purposes, the Modding API version will always appear in the top left corner.

BetterModList has a mod menu with the following options:
- You can change how the listed mods are distributed
	- "Fill to max" will cut off the list based on the "Max length" slider and push the rest of the list onto the other side of the screen
	- "Even split" will cut off the list halfway through and put an equal amount on the far side
	- "Disabled" will list all mods on one side
- You can choose whether the list appears on the left or right side
	- Disabling distribution does not affect your ability to put everything on the right side
	- If you choose to distribute the list to both sides, the list will still start alphabetically on your chosen side
- You can change the font size of the mod list (13 is default)
